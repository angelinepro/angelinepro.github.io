      <description>Why Scrape Baseball Data? Scraping Fangraphs Scraping Baseball Reference Wrap Up   Why Scrape Baseball Data? I recently enrolled in a data science bootcamp at Metis. Throughout the 12 weeks of the bootcamp, we work on five different projects to apply what we’ve learned thus far. One of the current projects includes webscraping data to use for predictive modeling. I opted to try my luck at scraping data from Fangraphs and Baseball Reference, neither of which have APIs that make it easy to get their data.</description>

      <description>The draft How I prepared for the draft My draft strategy   ###My first season in fantasy baseball
I joined a fantasy baseball league for the first time this year, which may come as a shock to those of you who know that I love both baseball and data. I was in a fantasy basketball league a few years ago, but because I haven’t watched basketball seriously in about 15 years, these were two very unsatisfying seasons.</description>

      <description>Positions for feast or famine   

###Where were we? If you’re reading about my fantasy baseball experience for the first time, welcome! You may be better oriented by reading this post first.  In the previous post, I wrote about my draft strategy using WAR, and how I selected a catcher (Buster Posey), in the second round, and a shortstop (Andrelton Simmons), in the fourth round. In this post, I go a little deeper into those two decisions, and I explore fantasy talent by defensive position.</description>

      <description>###Where were we? If you’re reading about my fantasy baseball experience for the first time, welcome! You may be better oriented by reading this first.  In the last three posts, I wrote about my draft strategy using projected WAR, and explored fantasy talent by defensive position. I discovered that WAR (Wins Above Replacement) was not a great way to select players given my league’s scoring categories. I calculated z-scores for my scoring categories instead, and looked at how that would have changed my draft picks.</description>

In the last two posts, I wrote about my draft strategy using projected WAR, and explored fantasy talent by defensive position. I discovered that WAR (Wins Above Replacement) was not a great way to select players given my league’s scoring categories. In the absence of a summary statistic to guide my decisions, I looked at all of the scoring categories.</description>
