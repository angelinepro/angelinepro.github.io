      <description>My first season in fantasy baseball What is fantasy baseball? The draft How I prepared for the draft My draft strategy Up next   My first season in fantasy baseball I joined a fantasy baseball league for the first time this year, which may come as a shock to those of you who know that I love both baseball and data.

      <description>Where were we? Projections vs. 2018 season statistics What-if land Lessons learned Next steps   Where were we? If you’re reading about my fantasy baseball experience for the first time, welcome! You may be better oriented by reading this first.
