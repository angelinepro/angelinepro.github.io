      <description>My first season in fantasy baseball What is fantasy baseball? The draft How I prepared for the draft My draft strategy Up next   My first season in fantasy baseball I joined a fantasy baseball league for the first time this year, which may come as a shock to those of you who know that I love both baseball and data.

      <description>Why Scrape Baseball Data? Scraping Fangraphs Scraping Baseball Reference Wrap Up   Why Scrape Baseball Data?
