I'm a City Research Scientist for the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. I play with varied health data sources and study disease patterns to understand the mental health of New Yorkers. I teach R programming and data visualization workshops to other data analysts at the agency. I also co-lead Education and Advocacy Programming for the Asian-American Pacific Islander Employee Resource Group.

My research interests are suicide prevention, mental health emergency department utilization, mental health surveillance, and racial data disaggregation.  

When I'm not playing with data, I'm practicing French, watching baseball, or trying a new restaurant with a dish I've never heard of.

You can reach me at my name at gmail dot com.
